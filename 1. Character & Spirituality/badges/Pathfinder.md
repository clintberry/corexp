# üõê Pathfinder

**Exploring and living by your values.**

## Why This Badge Matters
The Pathfinder badge helps you discover and live by the values that define who you are and who you want to become. Values like honesty, courage, faith, and kindness are more than words‚Äîthey guide our choices and shape our character. As you explore your beliefs and put them into practice, you'll build integrity and strength from the inside out. This badge encourages you to be intentional about how you live and to become someone others can trust and look up to.
