# üôè Spiritual Seeker (LDS Focus)

**Growing in your relationship with Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.**

## Why This Badge Matters
The Spiritual Seeker badge invites you to grow closer to Heavenly Father, strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ, and learn how the Holy Ghost can guide your life. As you complete this badge, you'll practice meaningful spiritual habits like prayer, scripture study, and service. These experiences will help you understand your divine identity, build your personal testimony, and prepare you to make and keep sacred covenants. The goal is not just to check off tasks, but to discover how living the gospel brings peace, purpose, and joy.
